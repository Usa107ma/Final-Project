# Customer Purchase Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer purchase amounts based on various customer features such as age, gender, product ID, purchase frequency, and more. The synthetic dataset used in this project contains 1 million rows and features 50,000 unique customers. The dataset is generated to simulate real-world e-commerce transactions and is used to build a machine learning model that predicts the purchase amount for each customer. The models trained and evaluated in this project include **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **XGBoost Regressor**.

## Problem Statement
Predicting customer purchase behavior is crucial for businesses to optimize marketing strategies, inventory management, and customer retention. This project addresses the challenge of predicting how much a customer will spend based on attributes like their demographics, previous purchasing behavior, and the type of products they buy. 

The goal is to develop a predictive model that can forecast **purchase amount** for customers, enabling businesses to take proactive steps in targeting their audience and maximizing revenue.

## Solution Approach
The solution involves the following steps:
1. **Data Generation**: A synthetic dataset is created with features such as customer ID, age, gender, product ID, purchase amount, and purchase date.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features are created, including purchase frequency, spending category, and average purchase amount.
3. **Model Training**: Three models are testedâ€”Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using cross-validation and metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 score.
